# Groupie Tracker
As a given assignment, the goal of Groupie Tracker was to create a website,
hosted with GoLang, and this latter had to display and depict data gathered
from an API from a given list.

## About the project
I personally chose the Pokémon TCG API. As I used to love collecting Pokémon cards in my early age, I figured it would be a way to reconnect with this part of the past. There is also a handful of possibilities with this API, and the documentation is well supllied.
I tried to follow a design that could remind one of some vibes you'd get while playing the actual video game (although it's about the Trading Card Game... close enough!).

## How to use the website
Current functionalities:
- search queries by Pokémon name
- search queries by expansion pack name
- search queries by type
...

## Credits
This website was created by [evzs](https://github.com/evzs) and uses the [Pokémon TCG API](https://pokemontcg.io) to fetch data about Pokémon cards.
