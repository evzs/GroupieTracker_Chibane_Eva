# "DEV JOURNAL"
Daily logs of my progression on the project and contributions to it.

### 2023-03-06
- API choice
- Repository setup

### 2023-03-07
Morning :
- cleaned the folder tree as well as I could until further edits
- brainstormed on some design ideas for the front, still undecided
- set up two "playground" branches, one for the front and possible ideas, another for handling the API with Go to try and understand better how it works before diving in

Afternoon :
- tried to tackle on the Go, struggling a bit with how everything works. I do have a clear visualization of what needs to be done and which elements are required for me to get started.
- getting a better grasp on how to link structures and external data, do need to polish up on how to handle API requests
- wrapping my head around templates too, trying to put everything together
- might start doing this with the actual API (there is actual documentation and I made something work, but at the moment I do have a lot of brain fog and cannot get myself into it without physically straining my neurons).
